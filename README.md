## üîÆ About the Game

The Mystic Vault is designed to be an atmospheric journey of discovery, not a test of reflexes. Players are encouraged to observe, think, and experiment with their surroundings. Each solved puzzle provides a short, mysterious clue, slowly unfolding a cryptic narrative and transforming the game's environment. Can you conquer all ten chambers and become the Master of the Mystic Vault?

1.  **HTML**: Add a new `.puzzle-stage` `div` with a unique ID (e.g., `id="puzzle-11"`) in `index.html`.
2.  **CSS**: Add corresponding styles for your new puzzle elements in `style.css`.
3.  **JavaScript**:
    -   Increment the `totalPuzzles` variable in the `MysticVaultGame` constructor.
    -   Add a `false` value to the `puzzleSolved` array.
    -   Create new `handlePuzzle11()` and `solvePuzzle11()` methods for your puzzle's logic.
    -   Add event listeners for your new elements in the `setupEventListeners()` method.
    -   Add a hint for your new puzzle in the `showHint()` method's `hints` array.
